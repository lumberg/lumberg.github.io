        <h2 id="Wedding Details">Wedding Details</h2>
        <p>Our wedding will be held at 6pm on Saturday, January 31st, 2014.  Details below:</p>
        
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Grand Palace Restaurant, South San Francisco, CA</p>


        <h3>No Registry</h3>
        <p>Due to our culture as a mixture of Taiwanese, American, and Chinese, we prefer to simplify everyone's lives by having no registry.  We believe that calling out gifts or which vendor to buy giftcards from are the same as just asking for cash.  So please, just give us cash.  Compementary red envelopes will be supplied in the wedding invitation as well as at the wedding.</p>
