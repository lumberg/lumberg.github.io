       <!--  <h3>Registry</h3>
          <p>Due to our culture as a mixture of Taiwanese, American, and Chinese, we prefer to simplify everyone's lives by having no registry.  We believe that calling out gifts or which vendor to buy giftcards from are the same as just asking for cash.  So please, just give us cash.  Complementary red envelopes will be supplied in the wedding invitation as well as at the wedding.</p>

          <p>Tracy met Leo outside of a bar in San Francisco while Tracy was on a date.  This magical first meeting happened while her date attempted to extract a cigarette from Leo's friends.  Tracy left with the beginnings of a wonderful relationship.  Her date failed to get a cigarette.  </p>

          <h3>Ukulele.</h3>
          
          <p>On the day of their one-year anniversary, Leo drew a bath for Tracy and sang a song for her on his Ukulele.  The song he played was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001226N38">Depeche Mode's Somebody</a>.  Shortly thereafter, Tracy discovered a diamond ring attached to a rubber ducky.  Leo got on his knee and asked Tracy to marry him.</p>
